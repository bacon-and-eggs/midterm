    <h2>Pet Photorgaphy Tips and Tricks </h2>

   
    <p>Great pet photography is about volume. You’ll need to take lots of pictures, and there will be<br>  plenty of duds, but among all those pics will be some gems.  Here are more professional pet <br> photography tips:


<ul> 
<li>


<span style="color: blue;"> <strong> Get down to your pet’s level. </strong> </span> Crouch down or lie on the floor rather than taking the photo <br> from high overhead. And try a few shots where you get in close.  If your pet is apt to back <br>  away, move in gradually with a treat ready or use a telephoto lens.
<li> 
<span style="color: red;">  <strong> Focus on the eyes. </strong> </span> The eyes are the window to the soul. Sounds corny but focusing on <br>  your pet’s eyes can help create an emotional connection with your viewer.
<li>

<span style="color: black;">  <strong> Avoid busy backgrounds. </strong> </span> 

Be thoughtful about what’s behind and around your pet. You  <br> want your pet to be the center of attention. Plain white walls, a large patch of green<br>  grass, or a light or dark solid carpet to contrast your pet’s coat are all great options.
<li> 


<span style="color: green;">  <strong> Use natrual light. </strong> </span> 
 Lots of natural light is best for pets who may get skittish around a <br>  flash. You can take photos of your dog outside or of your cat near a big sunny window.
